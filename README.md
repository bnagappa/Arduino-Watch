Arduino based watch.  Currently uses Seeedstudio's film series - OLED shield + bluetooth shield

Limitations
===========
Still working on getting Bluetooth working.  It does blink but isn't always discoverable.

Also, just to dash your hopes to the ground early, it doesn't work with iOS, and may never.  The problem is iOS restricts the use of the
Bluetooth Serial Port Profile, so if you're not jailbroken you can't use it.
